Where can I find documentation? 
-------------------------------

This repository is intended to provide publicly accessible, revision controlled source code for Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.

The best way to find what you are looking for would be to start with the documentation for the Reference Design/Tutorial you are interested in.  If you cannot find a document that covers the piece of code you are interested in, then it is likely that code is no longer supported.
